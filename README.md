# Hi! Welcome to my Portfolio!

I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Master's degree in Information and Data Science and hold an undergraduate degree in Data Science with a Computer Science Minor from UW-Madison. I have a deep passion for sports, technology, and finance, and I'm driven by the intersection of AI and real-world business impact.
Most recently, I've been working as a Data Scientist at C3.ai, where I build LLM-powered agent systems and production GenAI features for enterprise clients. My work spans RAG optimization, automated workflow design, and AI-driven content generation — turning complex, time-intensive processes into streamlined, intelligent pipelines. I've had the opportunity to work across Sales, Marketing, and Strategy teams, giving me a strong appreciation for how technical solutions translate into measurable business outcomes.
Throughout my academic and professional experience, I've worked collaboratively across teams on research and production projects, building deep skills in Python, R, SQL, LangChain, and cloud platforms like Vertex AI and AWS, along with strong written and oral communication skills.
I'm always open to connecting — feel free to reach out if you have any questions or would like to learn more about me!
